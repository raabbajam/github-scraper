I would like to get a list of github developers and information about them for academic research.

I would like this information for a random sample of 4,000 developers who meet the following characteristics:
1) Have a page with an email address
2) Have made a contribution within the past month to a repository with over 2 other contributors
3) Have made at least 10 contributions overall

I would like a flat file (csv) with the following columns:
Developer name
Developer email address
Join Date
Web page
developer id
Country
Contributions this year
Contributions over all
Contributions last month
Pull requests last month
Longest streak
Current streak
Number of repositories contributed to
Followers
Stars
Following

For each developer, I would like a row (repeating the information above in the first columns) for each repository they have contributed to in the last six months (up to 10 repos, if there are more, use only the ones with the largest numbers of contributors).  This row will include the following columns:

Name of repository
Description
Start date
Number of contributors to repository
Number of commits  to repository
Number of commits in last month  to repository
Number of branches  to repository
Number of releases  to repository
Number of contributions from the developer in the last month
Number of contributions from the developer overall
